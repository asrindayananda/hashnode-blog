## Create a AWS S3 bucket with Github Actions

Below we are going to run a Github Action that creates a S3 bucket in AWS Cloud

Github workflows have AWS CLI commands built in so all you need to do it run the command  [See this link for more information](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners) 

Create a  [GiHub ](https://github.com/) account

Create a new repository

Setup file for workflow
- Folder named .github
- Folder in .github called workflows
- Create a file called addS3BucketAWS.yml
- See  [Link for more info](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart) 

Add Below code to workflow file
- This code is setup only to run when you click action in repository

```
# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: addS3BucketAWS

# Controls when the action will run. 
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
  # push:
  #  branches: [ main ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:

  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
 
   # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master

      - name: Upload to S3
        run: |
          aws s3 mb s3://<ADD BUCKET NAME MAKE SURE IT'S UNIQUE>
        env:
          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          AWS_DEFAULT_REGION: 'eu-west-1'
```

- Change this in your action 
```
<ADD BUCKET NAME MAKE SURE IT'S UNIQUE>
```
    - Change it to a unique name. Remember S3 names are publicly chosen. Add a random string to end of your bucket name to make sure its unique eg. I used ```az-test-bucket-8923yhr98uh```

- Create AWS Keys
- Log into your AWS portal
- Click your cloud name 
- Click 'My Security Credentials'

Add keys to your GitHub Repository

Commit and push code if you havent already

Run your action
