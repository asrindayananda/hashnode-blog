## Installing the AWS EB CLI command on Debian 11 (WSL2)

In order to create docker containers in Amazon Web Services Elastic Beanstalk, you need the EB CLI command to run. I didn‚Äôt find the installation of this very straightforward forward so hopefully, this helps you.

# Install python
```
sudo apt update 
sudo apt -y upgrade
sudo apt install wget build-essential libreadline-gplv2-dev libncursesw5-dev \ libssl-dev libsqlite3-dev tk-dev libgdbm-dev libc6-dev libbz2-dev libffi-dev zlib1g-dev
sudo apt -y install wget
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.1/Python-3.9.1.tgz
tar xzf Python-3.9.1.tgz
python3.9 --version
```

## Set python symlink to run off just the python command
```
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python3.9 /usr/bin/python
python --version
```

# Install pip
```
sudo apt-get -y install python3-pip
```

# Install virtualenv
```
sudo pip install virtualenv
virtualenv --version
```

# Install git
```
sudo apt-get -y install git
```

# Create a folder and pull the eb command repo
```
sudo mkdir /eb-command
chown -R <ADDUSER>:<ADDUSER> /eb-command
cd eb-command
git clone https://github.com/aws/aws-elastic-beanstalk-cli-setup.git
```

Run EB CLI install file
```
python ./aws-elastic-beanstalk-cli-setup/scripts/ebcli_installer.py
```

A successful install will look like this
